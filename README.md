# Programming-languages-platforms-and-databases-usage-and-trend-report
This project is designed to identify trends for this year’s report on in-demand skills. One of the main data sources for the analysis is the latest Developer Survey, a comprehensive dataset that provides insights into the global developer community.

The goal of the project is to answer the following questions and present a visualized report:
Which **programming language**s are most in demand?
Which **database technologies** are currently most sought after?
Which Integrated Development Environments (**IDEs**) are the most popular?
The primary tool used for this work is IBM Cognos Analytics, and data wrangling was performed in Excel.

The dataset is a survey of IT professionals of various ages, primarily from the United States, India, and Germany, and contains 18,846 rows.
The data from the .csv file were split into several tables containing relevant subsets of information for easier analysis, and then loaded into IBM Cognos Analytics and visualized.
As a result, the project visualizes both the current technologies and future trends in preferences for programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
The results of the project were presented in the form of a presentation.
